# 👋 Hey, I'm Stephen Steyaert

I'm a CS student at Old Dominion and developer who learns by doing - currently working on my own interpreted scripting language in C++.

## 🧠 About Me

- :mortar_board: Junior studying Computer Science  
- 🧱 Partially self-taught - I dive deep into backend systems and APIs outside class  
- 🛠 Building an **interpreted scripting language** in modern C++ (no frameworks, no hand-holding)  
- 🕸️ Focused on backend development: APIs, databases, containerized deployments  
- :snake: Python was my intro to programming; I taught myself C++

## :test_tube: What I'm Working On

### :construction: [smplscript](https://github.com/Stephen-A-Steyaert/smplscript)

A small, interpreted scripting language with a built-in REPL, written entirely in C++.

**Current features & goals:**  
- :pencil2: Hand-built tokenizer + parser (recursive descent)  
- :repeat: Bytecode virtual machine  
- :inbox_tray: REPL and file execution  
- :abc: Dynamic typing and simple built-ins  
- :test_tube: Focused on learning, not performance  

> Learning how languages work — by building one from the ground up.
